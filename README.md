# Complain-Logger
A website for an intra-office or any oragnization's complain log management.
This website is developed using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL and an API for SMS service is used(which won't work now after downloading,
but you can change the API to one of your own).
It contains a Login/Register page for both the Admin and the user.
The files and there uses are listed as follows:
New_login.php-> For logging of user and admin.
New_register.php-> For creating new user
New_server.php-> This file contains the PHP code for adding and authenticating the user into database.
Ne_reg.php-> For registering new admin into the database.
Ne_server.php->This file contains the PHP code for adding and authenticating the admin into database.
New_index.php-> The page after logging of the user into the site.
new.php-> The page after logging of the admin into the site.
Rest all the pages are the intermediate files after doing any action that you can understand from the code.



// For Database//
I have used MySQL language to create database and tables in it.Used the phpmyadmin software included in the xampp package.Used the
xampp software for creating a localhost server in the system.

You can understand how to create the database and link it to the site from any youtube video available.
